# TutorialRewards Contract

## Project Title
TutorialRewards - Decentralized Reward System for Tutorial Uploads

## Project Description
TutorialRewards is a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain that incentivizes users to upload tutorials by rewarding them with Ether. Each time a user uploads a tutorial, they receive a set reward. The contract ensures that each user can only upload a tutorial once, and they can later claim their earned rewards. The reward rate per tutorial can be modified by the contract owner, and the contract can be funded by the owner to ensure there are sufficient funds for rewarding users.

## Project Vision
The vision behind the TutorialRewards project is to create a decentralized platform where users can earn rewards for contributing educational content in the form of tutorials. This system promotes knowledge sharing and incentivizes creators in a trustless environment. The reward mechanism encourages more content creation, creating a more vibrant and informative community.

## Key Features
- **Reward System**: Users earn Ether for each tutorial uploaded. The reward is set per tutorial and is distributed directly to the user's wallet.
- **One-Time Upload**: Each user can only upload one tutorial to avoid abuse of the reward system.
- **Reward Claiming**: Users can claim their accumulated rewards whenever they wish.
- **Owner Control**: The contract owner has the ability to adjust the reward amount per tutorial and fund the contract with Ether.
- **Secure and Trustless**: The smart contract operates without intermediaries, ensuring fairness and transparency in the reward distribution process.
